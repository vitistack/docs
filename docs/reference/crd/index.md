# CRDs

A **CRD (Custom Resource Definition)** is a way to extend Kubernetes by creating your own resource types. It allows you to define and manage custom objects—just like built-in types such as Pod or Service. CRDs are often used to model domain-specific concepts and are commonly paired with operators to automate complex workflows.

The CRSs are models for the Viti stack.
