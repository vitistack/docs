# Reference

The VITIstack documentation follows Divio documentation structure which is a method for organizing documentation in a clear and efficient way.

Reference is detailed and accurate information, such as API docs or configuration settings.

Reference have one job only: to describe. They are code-determined, because ultimately that's what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs, and so they should list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and set out how to use them.
