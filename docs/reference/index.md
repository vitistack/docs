# Reference

The Vitistack documentation follows Divio documentation structure which is a method for organizing documentation in a clear and efficient way.

Reference is detailed and accurate information, such as API docs or configuration settings. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

Reference have one job only: to describe. They are code-determined, because ultimately that's what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs, and so they should list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and set out how to use them.
