# Explanation

The VITIstack documentation follows Divio documentation structure which is a method for organizing documentation in a clear and efficient way.

Explanation is In-depth background knowledge and theoretical context, and they are understanding-oriented.

Explanations can equally well be described as discussions; they are discursive in nature. They are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the software, taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or even from different perspectives. You might imagine a discussion document being read at leisure, rather than over the code.
