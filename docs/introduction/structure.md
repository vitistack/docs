# Documentation structure

The VITIstack documentation follows Divio documentation structure which is a method for organizing documentation in a clear and efficient way. 

It divides content into four main categories:

- Tutorials – Step-by-step guides aimed at beginners, designed to teach by doing

- How-to guides – Practical instructions for solving specific problems

- Reference – Detailed and accurate information, such as API docs or configuration settings

- Explanation – In-depth background knowledge and theoretical context

This structure helps users quickly find the right kind of information depending on what they’re trying to do or understand.
